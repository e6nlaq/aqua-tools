# Aqua Tools

## About Aqua Tools

[Aqua](https://github.com/e6nlaq/aqua) is made in C++. Therefore, what cannot be done in C++ cannot be done in Aqua.

Therefore, we will use Node.js/Python to do what C++ cannot do instead.

## Install

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is required for installation.

Execute the following command

```bash
npm install git+https://github.com/e6nlaq/aqua-tools.git
```

Some Python scripts require external modules.

Run the script in the `install/` folder.

The modules to be installed are as follows

```
pyautogui
requests
```
